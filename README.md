# Dependency Injection 

## What's Dependency Injection (DI) ?
dependency injection is a design pattern in which an object or function receives other objects or functions that it depends.

## Relation Between Dependency Injection & Dependency Inversion ?
  - Dependency Injection : Design Pattern.
  - Dependency Inversion : The final SOLID Principle.
  - dependency injection aims to separate the concerns of constructing objects and using them, leading to loosely coupled programs .
  - The pattern ensures that an object or function which wants to use a given service should not have to know how to construct those services.
  
  ## What's problems does DI solve ??
  - can a class be independent from the creation of the objects it depends on?
  - can an application, and the objects it uses support different configurations?
  - can the behavior of a piece of code be changed without editing it directly?
  - Testing.
  - Coupling.
  - Usability.
  - Your code be more stable less boilerplate.
